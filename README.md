## 1. [A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners](https://github.com/mokgonyanetb/Data-Camp-Projects/tree/visualization/A%20Visual%20History%20of%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winners)
#### Explore a dataset from Kaggle containing a century's worth of Nobel Laureates. Who won? Who got snubbed?
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?

Well, let's find out! What characteristics do the prize winners have? Which country gets it most often? And has anybody gotten it twice? It's up to you to figure this out.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates) used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle.
- **Project Tasks**: In this project, you will use your data manipulation and visualization skills to explore patterns and trends over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners.

## 2. [Predictive Modeling for Agriculture](https://github.com/mokgonyanetb/Data-Camp-Projects/tree/main/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20Agriculture)
#### Dive into agriculture using supervised machine learning and feature selection to aid farmers in crop cultivation and solve real-world problems. 
A farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure two out of the four essential soil measures: Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium and pH

The expert realized that this is a classic feature selection problem, where the objective is to pick the most important features that could help predict the crop accurately. Can you help him?
- **Project Tasks**: In this project, you will be introduced to two techniques for feature selection and apply them to the farmer's problem. By working on this project, you will gain valuable insights into how machine learning can solve real-world agricultural problems.
## 3. [Arctic Penguin Exploration: Unraveling Clusters in the Icy Domain with K-means Clustering](https://github.com/mokgonyanetb/Data-Camp-Projects/tree/main/Clustering%20Antarctic%20Penguin%20Species)
Unsupervised learning is a critical task in machine learning, and it plays a significant role in this project. The objective is to delve into the information about penguins by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques on a thoughtfully curated dataset. By conducting thorough data exploration, extracting meaningful features, and employing advanced algorithms, this project aims to uncover concealed patterns, clusters, and relationships that exist within the dataset.
- **Project Tasks**: Perform unsupervised learning techniques to cluster Antarctic penguin species!
