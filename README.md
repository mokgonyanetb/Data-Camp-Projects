## 1. [A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners](https://github.com/mokgonyanetb/Data-Camp-Projects/tree/visualization/A%20Visual%20History%20of%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winners)
#### Exploring a dataset from Kaggle containing a century's worth of Nobel Laureates. Who won? Who got snubbed?
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?

Well, let's find out! What characteristics do the prize winners have? Which country gets it most often? And has anybody gotten it twice?

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates) used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle.
- **Project Tasks**: In this project, we use data manipulation and visualization skills to explore patterns and trends over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners.

## 2. [What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses](https://github.com/mokgonyanetb/Data-Camp-Projects/tree/worlds_oldest_businesses/What%20and%20Where%20are%20the%20World's%20Oldest%20Businesses)
##### Using join techniques to discover the oldest businesses in the world.
An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, we explore data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?

Like many business problems, the data we explore is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, we first use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, we use manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.

## 3. [The Android App Market on Google Play](https://github.com/mokgonyanetb/Data-Camp-Projects/tree/visualization/The%20Android%20App%20Market%20on%20Google%20Play)
#### Loading, cleaning, and visualizing scraped Google Play Store data to gain insights into the Android app market.
Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this project, we do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention. The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) for this project was scraped from the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en) website. While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty in scraping the latter as compared to the former.
- **Project Tasks**: Through a series of steps, we harness the complete data analyst toolbox to perform data wrangling, create visualizations, and carry out a descriptive and inferential analysis.

## 4. [Predictive Modeling for Agriculture](https://github.com/mokgonyanetb/Data-Camp-Projects/tree/main/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20Agriculture)
#### Diving. into agriculture using supervised machine learning and feature selection to aid farmers in crop cultivation and solve real-world problems. 
A farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure two out of the four essential soil measures: Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium and pH

The expert realized that this is a classic feature selection problem, where the objective is to pick the most important features that could help predict the crop accurately. Can you help him?
- **Project Tasks**: In this project, we are introduced to two techniques for feature selection and apply them to the farmer's problem. By working on this project, we gain valuable insights into how machine learning can solve real-world agricultural problems.
## 5. [Arctic Penguin Exploration: Unraveling Clusters in the Icy Domain with K-means Clustering](https://github.com/mokgonyanetb/Data-Camp-Projects/tree/main/Clustering%20Antarctic%20Penguin%20Species)
Unsupervised learning is a critical task in machine learning, and it plays a significant role in this project. The objective is to delve into the information about penguins by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques on a thoughtfully curated dataset. By conducting thorough data exploration, extracting meaningful features, and employing advanced algorithms, this project aims to uncover concealed patterns, clusters, and relationships that exist within the dataset.
- **Project Tasks**: Performing unsupervised learning techniques to cluster Antarctic penguin species!
