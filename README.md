# This repo contains projects completed on DataCamp


## 1. Predictive Modeling for Agriculture
### Dive into agriculture using supervised machine learning and feature selection to aid farmers in crop cultivation and solve real-world problems. 
A farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure two out of the four essential soil measures: Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium and pH

The expert realized that this is a classic feature selection problem, where the objective is to pick the most important features that could help predict the crop accurately. Can you help him?
- **Project Tasks**: In this project, you will be introduced to two techniques for feature selection and apply them to the farmer's problem. By working on this project, you will gain valuable insights into how machine learning can solve real-world agricultural problems.
## 2. Arctic Penguin Exploration: Unraveling Clusters in the Icy Domain with K-means Clustering
Unsupervised learning is a critical task in machine learning, and it plays a significant role in this project. The objective is to delve into the information about penguins by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques on a thoughtfully curated dataset. By conducting thorough data exploration, extracting meaningful features, and employing advanced algorithms, this project aims to uncover concealed patterns, clusters, and relationships that exist within the dataset.
- **Project Tasks**: Perform unsupervised learning techniques to cluster Antarctic penguin species!
